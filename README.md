<h1>Elite-Dangerous-RGB-Lighting-Integration</h1>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
This program reacts LIFX and Chroma RGB lighting with Elite Dangerous events.

This is still in development, bugs are still present and many features are to be added in the future.

This is a C# rewrite of a program that I wrote in Python (https://github.com/HectorBart/Elite-Dangerous-RGB-Lighting-Integration).
